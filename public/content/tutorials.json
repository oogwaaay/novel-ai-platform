            "Collaboration features are tiered to match different team needs. Free and Starter users can view all existing comments and activity logs, making it easy to see what feedback has been given, but cannot create new comment threads. This keeps the writing surface calm for solo drafts while still allowing you to review team feedback.",
            "Pro tier introduces powerful async collaboration tools: analytics, version history, and async review preparation. You can see all collaboration activity, track changes, and prepare documents for review—but real-time inline commenting remains locked. This tier is perfect for writers who want to track their work and prepare for team review without the distraction of live comments.",
            "Unlimited is the full collaboration tier. It unlocks everything: inline comments, @mentions, live cursors, presence indicators, section locking, and access to the upcoming live co-editing roadmap. This tier is designed for teams that need real-time collaboration and seamless feedback loops."

To create a comment, simply select any text in the Generator workspace—a comment icon will appear in the selection menu.",
            "Click the comment icon to open the comment thread. You can type your feedback, mention teammates using @handle syntax, and add context about what needs to change. Comments are automatically saved and visible to all team members with access to the project.",
            "Each comment thread supports replies, creating nested discussions about specific sections. This makes it easy to have detailed conversations about plot points, character development, or writing style without cluttering the main document. You can resolve comments when they've been addressed, keeping your workspace organized."

This gives you a complete picture of how the story evolved through team collaboration, making it easy to track the feedback loop from initial comment to final revision.",
